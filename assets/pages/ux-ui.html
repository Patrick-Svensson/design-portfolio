                        <p>
                            The world of whisky/whiskey is vast. The beverage is being produced in many countries and from a
                            variety of raw materials. Finding the way through that maze of whisky flavours can be difficult for
                            users who are curious and seek new whisky experiences.

                            Since most local wine and spirit shops would have limited assortments, I aimed to find a solution to
                            this problem by designing a web application that makes it easier for whisky enthusiasts (of drinking
                            age, of course) to get introduced to exciting and delicious whiskies.

                            The semi-structured interviews revealed a couple of key insights that became important to the design
                            process. 60% of the participants wanted the product information displayed to them in segments, with
                            only basic information at the first presentation. Then, access further information by navigating to
                            another page. 100% of the participants let the ratings given by other users guide them to what product
                            to buy.

                            In the empathise phase, I conducted semi-structured interviews with five whisky enthusiasts that fit
                            the key profile. I organised the interview notes on an affinity board and then grouped them under
                            different rubrics of Themes & Opportunities. The syntheses of that data made it possible for me to
                            define the design problem as:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How might we provide information and guidance to whisky enthusiasts to find new whisky favourites?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the ideation stage, I used techniques like Rapid Sketching and Crazy8 to come up with creative
                            ideas for solutions to the design problem.

                            Several ideas were extracted from the sketches and written down on sticky notes. The ideas could then

                        <p>
                            In Figma, I created low fidelity mockups and a prototype of the user flow for the whisky shop application. I find Figma an excellent tool to easily create and maneuver components and elements when designing mockups.

                            Most test recruits found the design easy and logical to use and efficiently managed to accomplish the flow task. There were however a couple of issues that needed attention.

                                It was not obvious to some participants that the product page was scrollable.

                                Some users did not primarily close the pop-up box by tapping on the exit-icon, but are used to the possibility of clicking anywhere on the screen window.

                            To remedy the first problem and clarify the scrolling ability of the design, I opted for higher contrast between the product cards and the background to make the cards more conspicuous.                        </p>

                            The second problem is probably more of a coding issue, but, to improve the prototype, I implemented the possibility to close the pop-up message box by tapping on the screen window.                        </p>
